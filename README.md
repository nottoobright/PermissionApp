# PermissionApp
Interview code for https://shivom.io/

- There are 5 public variables/functions in the contract.
- First init() the contract which makes you to caller of the contract.
- In the giveAccess() method, enter the address of the person you want to give access to
- This transaction will then be stored in the array permission as struct Permission
- In the checkAccess() method, enter your id (It'll be chronological, so if it's the first permission, enter 0. Will show in front-end to the user), and the address you want to check if you have received any permission from. The result will be a boolean.
- The contract is deployed on the Rinkeby testnet at the address: 0x5b73de6fc0db52fa1db834416549fe1fe03495df

I hope to have passed all of your requirements. Thanks
